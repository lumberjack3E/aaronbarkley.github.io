<p>I’m a cybersecurity professional with a blue-collar backbone — a former CNC machinist, facilities operator, and combat-deployed Army veteran who now builds secure systems instead of multi-tools.</p>

<p>I specialize in threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability management, but what sets me apart isn’t just the technical know-how — it’s the perspective.</p>

<p>I didn’t grow up in tech. I earned my stripes on the factory floor, in government buildings, and overseas in uniform. I've repaired critical infrastructure, rebuilt compromised networks, and sat across from both congressional representatives and non-technical business owners — always translating chaos into clarity.</p>

<p>Whether I’m scripting in Python, simulating a breach in my home lab, or helping another veteran break into tech, my approach stays the same: lead with purpose, communicate clearly, and leave things better than I found them.</p>

<p>I earned my B.Sc. in Cybersecurity from Oregon Tech, graduated with honors, and currently serve as Vice President of Northwest Veterans in Technology.</p>

<p>I’m also the guy who builds tools in his spare time — like an open-source resume analyzer for job-seeking vets — because I know how hard this transition can be.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m looking for the next opportunity to apply my experience in a cybersecurity role where I can make a difference and keep growing.</p>

<p>My ideal team values integrity, curiosity, and getting your hands dirty (whether that’s a server rack or a spreadsheet).</p>

<p>If that sounds like your company — or if you just want to talk shop about InfoSec, military-to-tech transitions, or brewing a decent cup of coffee in the field — I’d love to connect.</p>
