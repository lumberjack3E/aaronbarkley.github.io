<h4>Veteran Advocacy Trip – Washington D.C. (Student Veterans of America)</h4>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> As President of the Student Veterans of America (SVA) chapter at Oregon Institute of Technology, I traveled to Washington D.C. to advocate for enhanced support for student veterans. During this visit, I participated in policy briefings and met with Congressional staff to discuss the challenges faced by veterans in higher education. Our collective efforts contributed to the passage of the Senator Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Veterans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act, a comprehensive law that, among other provisions, expands education benefits for veterans and their families.</p>

<p><strong>My Role:</strong> I served as one of the official representatives for Oregon Tech’s SVA chapter. I participated in policy briefings, attended the SVA National Conference (NatCon), and met with Congressional staff to advocate for expanded GI Bill benefits, mental health resources, and smoother transitions for veterans entering STEM and cybersecurity fields. I also networked with other chapter leaders to share ideas and strengthen inter-campus collaboration.</p>

<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> Advocacy materials, collaborative documents, LinkedIn, policy packets, public speaking decks</p>

<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Our efforts helped influence ongoing legislative conversations around educational benefits and career transitions. The experience strengthened my ability to communicate technical and veteran-related issues to non-technical audiences, build consensus, and represent a diverse population of students. It also expanded NWVIT’s reach through early discussions with other veteran tech leaders. The enactment of the Dole Act represents a significant advancement in veterans' education benefits. Notably, it includes provisions that temporarily broaden eligibility for the Fry Scholarship, allowing more surviving spouses and children of fallen service members to access educational assistance. Additionally, the Act removes time constraints on the use of these benefits, providing greater flexibility for beneficiaries.</p>

<p><strong>My Vision:</strong> Cybersecurity isn’t just about technology — it’s about people. Being a voice for those who often feel overlooked is part of my leadership ethos. This trip deepened my commitment to making tech more accessible to veterans and showed me how policy, advocacy, and engineering can intersect to drive meaningful change.</p>
