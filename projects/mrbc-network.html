<h4>Molalla River Brewing Co. – Network & Security Upgrade</h4>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> A comprehensive network redesign and security upgrade plan for Molalla River Brewing Company (MRBC), a 6-acre event space and community gathering hub in Molalla, OR. The project was scoped to support their taproom, outdoor event space, rental unit, and growing food cart area with scalable, secure connectivity and operational modernization.</p>

<p><strong>My Role:</strong> I acted as project manager, network architect, and security consultant. I assessed the current infrastructure, identified critical vulnerabilities in their IoT devices and outdated systems, and designed a secure, scalable network architecture. I selected TP-Link Omada hardware for its cost-effectiveness and ease of use by non-technical staff. I also developed a full training program for staff adoption, security hygiene, and operational software usage. Throughout the project, I worked directly with the owner, vendor partners, and regulatory considerations while aligning with realistic small-business constraints.</p>

<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> TP-Link Omada EAP610 access points (indoor/outdoor), ER7212PC 3-in-1 Router/Switch/Controller, Cat6 Ethernet, VPN configuration, mobile network monitoring tools, manual & digital operational workflow redesign</p>

<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Although the implementation was ultimately deferred due to higher-priority property upgrades (drainage, food truck expansion, etc.), the planning phase delivered immediate value. MRBC now has a clear, scalable infrastructure plan, security recommendations, a staff training package, and vendor alignment — positioning them to execute quickly once timing aligns. Stakeholders expressed appreciation and indicated intent to revisit the full installation in future budget cycles.</p>

<p><strong>My Vision:</strong> This project represented the heart of what I love to do: helping small businesses — especially those central to their communities — secure their systems and modernize in a way that's both approachable and effective. MRBC reminded me that security isn't just about firewalls and access points. It's about people, workflows, and protecting the heartbeat of a business. Even without a final install, the chance to be their guide and help future-proof their operations was a win.</p>
