<h4>Incident Response & Threat Hunting Lab</h4>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong> A self-hosted, multi-segmented lab environment built to simulate real-world attacks and sharpen my skills in threat detection, incident response, adversary emulation, and blue-team forensics. The lab is designed to mirror small enterprise networks and provide repeatable environments for testing tools, rules, and workflows.</p>

<p><strong>My Role:</strong> I designed and deployed the lab from the ground up. I built segmented internal networks with attack, monitoring, and victim machines, and integrated tools like Splunk, Zeek, and the Elastic Stack. I’ve simulated phishing campaigns, malware infections, lateral movement, and exfiltration to test detection capabilities. I developed and tuned detection rules, practiced triage and containment, and built documentation for use as future playbooks. I also incorporated physical security techniques — such as lockpicking and social engineering exercises — to emphasize full-spectrum risk.</p>

<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Security Onion, Splunk, Zeek, Wireshark, Metasploit, Suricata, Autopsy, Volatility, Elastic Stack (ELK), Python, Bash, pfSense, Cisco Catalyst switch, simulated phishing and malware payloads</p>

<p><strong>Impact:</strong> The lab has been instrumental in translating theoretical knowledge into hands-on proficiency. I’ve used it to sharpen detection logic, identify gaps in tooling, and explore red-team tactics from a defender's perspective. It’s also provided a foundation for continuous learning as I test new tools, write custom scripts, and share findings with peers and mentees. It’s helped me build confidence, speed, and structure — all critical for responding under pressure.</p>

<p><strong>My Vision:</strong> This lab isn’t just a sandbox — it’s a testing ground for how I think, act, and grow as a security professional. I wanted to build something that mirrors the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, where failure is safe but learning is real. My long-term goal is to expand this into a resource I can use to mentor others breaking into the field, especially veterans transitioning into cyber. It’s my proving ground and my teaching ground.</p>
